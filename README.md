# Decentralized Influencer Toolkit
My goal is to build tools that allow anyone to become a defluencer (decentralized influencer). Decentralize the means of communications by decentralizing the data itself. Once the data is decentralized anyone can build upon it without restriction. New platforms, apps and websites with the same data underneat.

## Protocols
- Video addressing.
  - Allow fetching video by timecode & quality.
  - Handle live video by linking data together in a chain.
  - Share clips without data duplication.
- Live streaming.
- Live chat.
- Moderation tools.
- Blog.
- Multimedia content feed.
- Comments.
- Friends List.

## Prototypes
Most features are fonctionnal but still require testing.
- Streaming live video with adaptative birate.
- Live chat with ethereum address as identity and custom display names.
- Ban chat users & appoint moderators.
- Stream pre-recorded videos & past live streams with adaptative birate.
- Display markdown file as blog post.
- Multimedia content feed.
- Comments on any content.
- Fetch friends content & comments.
